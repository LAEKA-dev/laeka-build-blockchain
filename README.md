1. The blockchain operator creates  Kubernetes cluster (<b>32CPU, 32RAM, 3 workers recommended</b>) and an Hyperledger Fabric network.
2. The operator installs and instantiates the smart contract on the network.
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network.
4. The React UI uses the Node.js application API to interact and submit transactions to the network.
5. The user interacts with the insurance application web interface to update and query the blockchain ledger and state.
